Rust for C# programmers
=======================

You might have heard about Rust, a new programming language developed by Mozilla Research. There are excellent resources out there if you want to learn the language, but to my knowledge there isn't much oriented to C# programmers. This is a small step at solving that issue.

This document is part of a Rust coding dojo held at [Infi](https://infi.nl) on November 8th 2018. It is not a detailed tutorial on how to become a Rust expert, though if that is your aim you can give a try to [The Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/2018-edition/index.html). Our Rust dojo is meant to awaken interest in the language and give you the tools to start your Rust journey. We use C# as starting point, so expect lots of comparisons between the two languages, including code.

# Introduction

## Why a new programming language?

Rust is a quite unique language. From a researcher's perspective, it is interesting because it applies decades of academic research in a way that is actually usable. From a programmer's perspective, one particular strength is that it forces you to think rigorously about your programs, thereby helping you avoid many kinds of bugs that other languages happily allow. As you can imagine, there is a lot to learn about programming just by learning the language.

Rust draws lots of inspiration from existing languages and integrates many features that you will find in Scala, C# or Haskell. However, there are two features that make Rust unique: *performance on by default* and *thread-safety on by default*. We will discuss them below.

### Performance on by default

Performance is one of the most touted features of Rust.

No unsafety. All this without having a garbage collector.

TODO: add example comparing C# and Rust

### Thread safety on by default

TODO: add example of a data race allowed by C# and prevented by Rust

## Other features

Talk about ADTs/enums, pattern matching
